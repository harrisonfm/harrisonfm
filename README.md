This is John Harrison's personal coding and photography portfolio, visible at http://harrisonfm.com. It utilizes Backbone JS on the frontend and Wordpress with the [JSON API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/) plugin.

This project was scaffolded with Reintroducing's [Backbone-Require generator](https://github.com/reintroducing/generator-bbr).
